# wavetown
Wavetown is an interactive animation that allows users to explore communication systems in a cartoon setting. Wavetown was originally created as a prototype demo for potential use in a larger educational radio science project or mobile application. Our team never pursued Wavetown further so for now, it is just a prototype demo.
